# Summary
Myartspace is an admistrative website that was developed to imitate real world web application to help admins to create new art classes as well as registering members to their interested classes. This was an assignment project for our module 'Web Application Development' where our focus was to learn to develop back-end web application using server side scripting language, PHP and SQL to perform CRUD operations on our database.
